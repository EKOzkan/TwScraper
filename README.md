TwScraper is a twitter scraper and analyzer tool with ui. You can scrap tweets based on keywords, hastags, tweet dates and users. And then you can do a sentimental analysis that analyses if tweet has "negative", "positive" or "neutral" content. It will export the results of scraping as csv file.

I will convert this program into a python library, but you can run the program directly from source code.
